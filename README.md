# JavaScript Async/Await Revision

Welcome to the `Javascript-async-await-Revision` repository! This project is designed to demonstrate the use of `async` functions, `await`, and `Promise` in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations and managing errors.

## üìö Overview

Asynchronous programming is a key concept in modern JavaScript. This repository provides a practical example to help you understand how `async` functions and `await` can simplify asynchronous code. This example is ideal for both beginners and those looking to enhance their understanding of async programming.

### üîç Key Concepts

- **Promises**: Learn how to create and handle promises that represent the result of an asynchronous operation.
  
- **Async Functions**: Understand how to define `async` functions, which always return a promise, and use the `await` keyword to pause execution until a promise is resolved or rejected.

- **Error Handling**: Explore how to use `try...catch` blocks within `async` functions to manage errors effectively.
